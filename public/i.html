        <b>Enterprise Continuum provides a consistent language for communicating differences between
      architectures so that architectures and solutions can be reused. Also EC is </b> <br /> 1) Architecture
      Repository View, <br /> 2) Methods for classifying architecture and solution artifacts,
      <br /> 3) Re-use the standard solution whenever possible, instead of re-inventing the wheel, in other
      words, the telecommunications industry has a well-established billing software and solutions for
      both its retail services and services based on connectivity and cost, use those solutions
      (software) rather than writing your own software solution of your own production, this helps
      ensure business continuity as you re-use the standard industry experience, rather than redoing
      your own solution,<br /> 4) Sometimes even the language specific to the industry standard, is of great
      importance, for example, if you are talking about Billingham Internet connections in the field of
      telecommunications, understand it, when, as if you invent new words to mark the same, you end
      up confusing stakeholders /partners associated with
      the generalization of a specific decision or setting a common solution based on the external
      factors influencing the context of architecture.
